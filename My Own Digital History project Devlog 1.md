Plan and Dateset

My goal for My Own Digital History project is to map data from 1812 records, specifically the 100th Regiment, to show concentrations of people based on origin, background and status. I'm hoping that by mapping information on the soldiers, either geographically or in a minidatabase, will allow for future researcher on major events in the war, into individuals, or perhaps help people learn more about their ancestors. 

Tasks and Challenges 

I've already acquired the Regiment's enlistment rolls, payrecords and casaulty lists from the National Archives in the UK to work with. These provide me with plenty of period data. The major challenge/hurdle right now is processing all the information. The data is currently held on scanned images but I don't think ordinary transcription software will be able to tackle the elegant regency cursive. Old-fashioned transcription is the main method right now.
