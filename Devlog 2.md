Project so far. I've been trying to use microsoft azure to recognize handwriting to transcribe my documents faster. I set up azure but I'm having trouble getting the code to do what I want. I spent today trying to solve error messages but it's a frustrating experience trying to interpret what they are talking about. I think I'll just sent a screenshot to the help channel tomorrow once I write a list of what I've done so far. Nothing really done.
